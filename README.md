## Project: Car Rental Management System ##

Our project will be a management system for a hypothetical car rental service in which users can request, take out, and return cars. Users may request specific cars, however, if that car is currently rented out, they will have to wait for that car to be returned.

#### User Interface: ####
* The user will first be prompted with a login screen, asking them to either create a new account or log in to an existing account
* Once either a new account is created or an account is logged into, the screen will then switch to a menu in which the user has the options to view available cars, view cars that are currently being rented out, view the current car they have rented out if any, return a car if they already have one in their possession, or log out.
  * If they choose to view available cars, they can then select a car to rent out, in which it will then display more information about the car and prompt asking whether or not they are sure this is the car they want


#### Tasks Implemented: ####

This project will utilize
* Working with files to store user information (So info isnâ€™t lost in between sessions)
* Allocating memory to create additional users
* Shared memory and semaphores to save data on how many cars are available and which ones are already rented out

#### Data structures: ####
* Structs
  * A car struct with vehicle characteristics
  * A user struct for username, passwords, and current car
* Arrays
  * Array of available cars
  * Array of cars currently rented out
